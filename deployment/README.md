SFC Deployment & Installers
===========================

That area describes how you can deploy & install SFC on the edge and/or into your aws account as AWS IoT Greengrass v2 components.

## SFC as AWS IoT Greengrass v2 Components

### Option 1 - [`create components with current sfc-release`](greengrass-sfc-components/release-version-as-components-cdk/README.md)

**`Recommended`**: Start here, if you want sfc greengrass components with a recent sfc-release.


### Option 2 - [`create components from local build`](greengrass-sfc-components/local-build-as-components-py/README.md)

Use that option if you want to bootstrap greengrass components with recent local changes (e.g. testing out new adapters)
