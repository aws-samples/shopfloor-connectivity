SFC Deployment & Installers
===========================

that area describes how you deploy & install SFC into your aws account

## AWS IoT Greengrass v2 Components

### option 1 - [`create components with current sfc-release`](greengrass-sfc-components/release-version-as-components-cdk/README.md)

**recommended**: start here if you want sfc greengrass components with a recent sfc-release.


### option 2 - [`create components from local build`](greengrass-sfc-components/local-build-as-components-py/README.md)

use that option if you want to bootstrap greengrass components with recent local changes (e.g. testing out new adapters)
