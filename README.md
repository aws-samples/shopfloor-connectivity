Shopfloor Connectivity Framework (SFC)
=====================================

## WIP: Tenets for that README

- KISS
- in describing text - link to docs/README.md using markdown-refs
- Sequence could be:
    - What is SFC?
        - How does it fit into IDF & UNS patterns
    - How can I run it locally to test out things? (for HellowWorld use sfc artifacts from here: https://dyy8lqvmsyeqk.cloudfront.net/)
        - show off mock-up data sources like opcua/plcsim and pipe to IoT Core & Sitewise
        - create catchy screen-capture gifs showing sources & target raw data streams
    - How can I configure it?
    - How can I deploy it using Greengrass deployments?
    - How can I build it?
    - How can I write my own adapters?
