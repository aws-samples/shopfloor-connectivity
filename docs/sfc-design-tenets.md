# High level design overview and tenets

SFC design and implementation tenets of the software are based on the experience from working with our industrial
customers. A major learning point is that hardly any assumptions can be made about the environment in which the software
is operated and integrated.

## Execution environment and platform dependencies

Edge software in industrial environments is typically running on a mix of different hardware architectures, operating
systems and runtimes. SFC can be deployed on platforms supporting a JVM and does not have platform or OS specific
requirements. SFC protocol and targets adapters can be implemented and executed in other runtimes, e.g., .NET, as well.

SFC components can be deployed and executed as:

- Standalone applications
- Containers in Docker or Kubernetes
- Greengrass components

## Extensibility

SFC can be [extended](./sfc-extending.md) with additional protocol and target adapters. New adapters can be implemented and added without
modifications to the SFC Core software. Using the infrastructure (JVM) code which is part of the framework, which
reduces the effort to implement new adapters and allows developers to focus on just the protocol or target specific
logic. Adapters can be implemented using a JVM language, or if due to the availability of protocol libraries or other
technical reasons this is not possible, alternative languages and runtimes can be used. JVM based adapters can run
either in-process with the SFC Core or as separate services in their own process. Adapters which are not JVM based
implementations can only run in their own process.

It is also possible to build and configure the following extensions to the SFC Core:

- *Logging*: the standard logging, which writes the output to the process console, can be replaced by a custom logger.
  The SFC configuration allows a [custom logger](./sfc-extending.md#custom-logging) to be configured by adding the library which implements it to the
  configuration.

- *Configuration*: the default configuration is using a JSON file, which is monitored for updates to the actual file, or
  updates to environment variables used for which the configuration file can contain placeholders. As configuration
  data, in customer environments, may be managed and stored in external systems, it is possible to implement and
  configure a [custom configuration provider](./sfc-extending.md#custom-configuration-handlers), that can actively and periodically call out to external systems, or wait
  for incoming calls, to obtain the configuration data to build or extend the SFC configuration dynamically.

- *Metrics*: SFC comes with a metrics collector for to the AWS CloudWatch Metrics service, which can be optionally added
  to the SFC configuration. [Custom metrics collectors](./sfc-extending.md#custom-metric-writers) can be implemented and configured.



## Networking

In industrial environments there are two different types of networks that have distinct characteristics and purposes.

IT (Information Technology) networks are used for communication and data management in a traditional office or
enterprise environment. These networks are designed for supporting business processes, data storage and retrieval, and
user communication.

OT (Operational Technology) networks, on the other hand, are used for controlling and monitoring physical processes in
industrial and manufacturing environments. These networks are designed for real-time monitoring and control of
machinery, production processes, and other industrial systems. They typically use specialized protocols and are managed
by operations or engineering departments. OT networks are often modelled after
the [Perdue network model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture).

In reality in most industrial environments OT and IT networks are not directly connected. Industrial devices are
unlikely to connect to the public internet. Solutions that retrieve data from these devices and submit this machine data
to a cloud service must be capable of handling this network separation, restrictions due to firewalls, proxies, DMZ’s
and offline and/or intermittent connectivity.

SFC is designed so that protocol adapters, the SFC Core and target adapters can be deployed as separate services in
different networking or cloud environments The diagrams below show some of the possible deployment scenarios.

SFC components running as microservices can explicitly specify which network interface to use for network connections to (OT) data sources and other components. By specifying the network interface, microservices can ensure that their network traffic flows through the desired network path, which can be important for optimizing network performance and ensuring network security.

By [configuring](./sfc-securing-component-traffic.md) the required X509 certificates all network traffic can be secured using server side or mutual TLS.



## Scalability

As protocol and target adapters can run as standalone services, multiple instances can be instantiated on the same
system as the SFC Core, or on external systems to distribute the load and footprint of the components. By distributing
the load and footprint of these components, the overall throughput and scalability of the system can be improved. This
approach also enables better resource utilization and fault tolerance.



## Store and forward

For targets that require network access to send the collected data to their destinations, it is possible to use
intermediate [store and forward targets](sfc-targets-chaining.md#store-and-forward-target). Intermediate targets can be
configured in between the SFC Core and one or more target adapters by using target daisy-chaining. If the end target loses 
connectivity the intermediate target will store the data, optionally encrypted, for a [configured](./targets/store-and-forward-target.md) amount of time, data 
volume or number of messages, and will resubmit the data when the target regains network connectivity, in either FIFO or LIFO mode.

[Target chaining](./sfc-targets-chaining.md) is generic mechanism in SFC for adding additional processing steps, like store and forwarding as
described above, for target data without changes to the actual end targets.


## High availability

All SFC components that can run as microservices in their own processes can be configured to have an endpoint for
handling [health endpoints](./sfc-health-endpoints). Mechanisms used to manage the service instances, (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes) can use
these endpoints in their configuration to check the status of a service and recycle instances failing to respond to the
health probe requests. This approach can help ensure the reliability and availability of microservices-based systems.



## Data types and formats

SFC provides full end to end data type-fidelity. Data which is read from the protocol adapters is delivered to the
target adapters as the same type of data as it was read. It does support numeric types, (Unicode)strings, time formats,
structured types, as well as vectors of these types.

By applying configured [transformations](./sfc-data-processing-filtering.md#transformations), which consists of a sequence of one or more provided transformation operators,
the SFC can transform every individual value that is read from a protocol adapter. Transformations can be used to
standardize data values and types read from different devices to be delivered in a consistent way to the consuming
target adapters. The SFC framework comes with a rich set of [transformation operators](./core/transformation-operator-configuration.md).

A source configuration can be configured to compose structured values from selected individual from that source. Channels, containing structures values,
can be configured to be decomposed into individual values in the output.

The SFC core can also [aggregate](./core/aggregation-config.md) the data into batches and apply aggregation function to that data, which then can be
sent instead of, or with the individual values. This can be used to reduce the data volume by sending only the output of
selected aggregation functions or the number of data messages to the consuming targets. Additionally, transformations,
as described above, can be applied to the aggregated data.

The data is delivered to the target in a defined hierarchical structure. An additional, [template based, transformation](./sfc-target-templates.md),
using Apache Velocity, can be configured for each target to select subsets, restructure or transform the data or
transform it into formats like CSV, YAML or XML.
